# immigration
It took me almost 9 years to get my greencard since I moved to 🇺🇸.

I got anxious before my greencard interview. To make it easier for me to practice the interview questions I created theimmigrationinterview.com.

It has a series of questions that you may get on your employment based greencard interview. If you want to add more questions, create a pull request here.

If you find this website useful please buy me ☕️.
